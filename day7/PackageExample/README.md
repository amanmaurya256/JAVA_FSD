## üéØ Learning Objectives
By working through these examples, you will understand:
1. **Built-in Packages**: How to use Java's standard library packages
2. **Custom Packages**: How to create and organize your own packages
3. **Code Organization**: Benefits of grouping related classes
4. **Name Collision Avoidance**: How packages prevent naming conflicts
5. **Import Statements**: Different ways to import and use classes

## üìù File Execution Order

### **Step 1: MathDemo.java** (Built-in Packages)
**Purpose**: Demonstrates Java's built-in packages
**What it shows**: 
- Using `java.lang.Math` (automatically imported)
- Using `java.util.Scanner` (requires import)
- Mathematical operations and constants

**How to run**:
```bash
# Navigate to PackageExample directory
cd "C:\Manii\Training\temp\Day7\PackageExample"

# Compile and run
javac MathDemo.java
java MathDemo
```

**Sample interaction**:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Maximum of 10.0 and 5.0 = 10.0
Square root of 10.0 = 3.1622776601683795
...
```

---

### **Step 2: Calculator.java** (Custom Package Creation)
**Purpose**: Create a utility package with reusable functions
**What it shows**:
- Package declaration (`package utilities;`)
- Public static methods for reuse
- Proper documentation and comments

**Note**: This file is in the `utilities` package and will be used by other demos.

---

### **Step 3: Student.java** (Data Model Package)
**Purpose**: Create a model class for data representation
**What it shows**:
- Package declaration (`package models;`)
- Encapsulation (private fields, public methods)
- Constructors and validation
- toString() method override

**Note**: This file is in the `models` package and will be used by other demos.

---

### **Step 4: OrganizationDemo.java** (Package Organization)
**Purpose**: Demonstrate how packages organize code
**What it shows**:
- Import statements for custom packages
- Using classes from different packages
- Practical example combining utilities and models

**How to run**:
```bash
# Compile all required files first
javac utilities/Calculator.java
javac models/Student.java
javac OrganizationDemo.java

# Run the demo
java OrganizationDemo
```

**Expected output**:
```
=== Package Organization Demo ===
1. Using Calculator from 'utilities' package:
Calculator: Adding 10 + 5
Addition result: 15
...
2. Using Student from 'models' package:
Student [Name: Alice Johnson, Age: 20, ...]
```

---

### **Step 5: List.java** (Custom Class with Same Name)
**Purpose**: Create a custom class that shares a name with Java's built-in class
**What it shows**:
- Custom implementation of a List
- Same name as `java.util.List` but in different package
- Simple array-based operations

**Note**: This file is in the `mypackage` package and demonstrates name collision prevention.

---

### **Step 6: CollisionDemo.java** (Name Collision Avoidance)
**Purpose**: Show how packages prevent naming conflicts
**What it shows**:
- Using both `java.util.List` and `mypackage.List` in same program
- Import statements vs fully qualified names
- Practical comparison of different List implementations

**How to run**:
```bash
# Compile required files
javac mypackage/List.java
javac CollisionDemo.java

# Run the demo
java CollisionDemo
```

**Expected output**:
```
=== Name Collision Avoidance Demo ===
1. Using Java's built-in List (java.util.List):
Java List contents:
  [0] Apple
  [1] Banana
  [2] Cherry

2. Using our custom List (mypackage.List):
Added 'Dog' to custom List
=== Custom List Contents ===
Size: 3 items
[0] Dog
[1] Cat
[2] Bird
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Run All Demos Individually
```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd "C:\Manii\Training\temp\Day7\PackageExample"

# 1. Built-in packages demo
javac MathDemo.java && java MathDemo

# 2. Package organization demo
javac utilities/Calculator.java models/Student.java OrganizationDemo.java
java OrganizationDemo

# 3. Name collision demo
javac mypackage/List.java CollisionDemo.java
java CollisionDemo
```

### Option 2: Compile Everything at Once
```bash
# Navigate to the directory
cd "C:\Manii\Training\temp\Day7\PackageExample"

# Compile all Java files
javac utilities/*.java models/*.java mypackage/*.java *.java

# Run demos in order
java MathDemo
java OrganizationDemo
java CollisionDemo
```

## üí° Key Concepts Explained

### **1. Package Declaration**
```java
package utilities;  // Must be first non-comment line
```
- Must match directory structure
- Groups related classes together
- Creates namespace to avoid conflicts

### **2. Import Statements**
```java
import utilities.Calculator;     // Import specific class
import java.util.*;             // Import all classes from package
```
- Brings classes from other packages into scope
- Reduces need for fully qualified names
- Makes code more readable

### **3. Fully Qualified Names**
```java
java.util.List<String> javaList = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
mypackage.List customList = new mypackage.List();
```
- Alternative to import statements
- Explicitly specifies which class to use
- Useful when class names conflict

### **4. Access Modifiers with Packages**
- `public`: Accessible from any package
- `protected`: Accessible within package and subclasses
- (default): Accessible only within same package
- `private`: Accessible only within same class

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Compilation Errors**

1. **"Package does not exist"**
   ```
   Error: package utilities does not exist
   ```
   **Solution**: Make sure you're in the correct directory and the package files are compiled first.

2. **"Class not found"**
   ```
   Error: Could not find or load main class OrganizationDemo
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure you're running from the correct directory where the .class files are located.

3. **"Package declaration doesn't match directory"**
   ```
   Error: The declared package "utilities" does not match the expected package
   ```
   **Solution**: This is an IDE warning. The code will still compile and run correctly from command line.

### **Best Practices**
- Always compile package classes before classes that use them
- Use meaningful package names that reflect functionality
- Follow Java naming conventions (lowercase package names)
- Keep related classes in the same package
- Use imports to make code more readable

## üìö Additional Learning Resources

### **Related Java Concepts**
- Access modifiers and encapsulation
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Java Collections Framework
- Exception handling
- Documentation with JavaDoc

### **Next Steps**
After mastering these examples, explore:
- Creating JAR files with packages
- Maven/Gradle package management
- Nested packages and sub-packages
- Package-level documentation
- Module system (Java 9+)

## üéâ Conclusion
These examples demonstrate the fundamental concepts of Java packages in a simple, progressive manner. Packages are essential for organizing large Java applications and preventing naming conflicts in real-world development.

**Remember**: Good package organization makes your code more maintainable, reusable, and professional!
