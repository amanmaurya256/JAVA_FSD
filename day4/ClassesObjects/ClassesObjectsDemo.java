/*
=== DETAILED EXPLANATION OF CLASSES & OBJECTS ===

 WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CODE:

1. CLASS DEFINITION:
   â€¢ We created a 'Student' class which serves as a blueprint
   â€¢ The class contains instance variables (name, age, course, marks)
   â€¢ The class contains methods (displayInfo, calculateGrade, isEligibleForScholarship)

2. OBJECT CREATION:
   â€¢ We created 3 different Student objects: student1, student2, student3
   â€¢ Each object is created using the 'new' keyword
   â€¢ Syntax: Student student1 = new Student();

3. SETTING OBJECT DATA:
   â€¢ We assigned different values to each object's instance variables
   â€¢ Each object has its own separate copy of the variables
   â€¢ student1.name is different from student2.name

4. CALLING METHODS:
   â€¢ We called methods on each object using dot notation
   â€¢ student1.displayInfo() displays information specific to student1
   â€¢ Methods can access the object's instance variables

5. OBJECT INDEPENDENCE:
   â€¢ Each object maintains its own state
   â€¢ Changing one object's data doesn't affect other objects
   â€¢ This demonstrates encapsulation at the object level

ðŸ“š KEY CONCEPTS LEARNED:

â€¢ Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects
â€¢ Object: An instance of a class with its own data and behavior
â€¢ Instance Variables: Data that belongs to each object individually
â€¢ Methods: Functions that define what objects can do
â€¢ Dot Notation: objectName.variableName or objectName.methodName()
â€¢ Object Independence: Each object has its own memory space

ðŸŽ¯ IMPORTANT POINTS FOR INDIAN STUDENTS:

â€¢ Think of a class like a form (à¤œà¥ˆà¤¸à¥‡ admission form)
â€¢ Objects are like filled forms - each student fills their own details
â€¢ Each student (object) has their own name, age, marks (instance variables)
â€¢ All students can perform same actions like displayInfo (methods)
â€¢ Just like each student has separate mark sheets, each object has separate data

ðŸ’¡ REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
â€¢ Class = Car blueprint/design
â€¢ Objects = Actual cars made from that blueprint
â€¢ Each car has its own color, speed, fuel level (instance variables)
â€¢ All cars can start, stop, accelerate (methods)

ðŸ”‘ MEMORY CONCEPT:
â€¢ Class definition is stored once in memory
â€¢ Each object gets its own memory space for instance variables
â€¢ Methods are shared among all objects of the same class
