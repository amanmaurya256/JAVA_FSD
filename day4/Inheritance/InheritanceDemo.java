/*
=== DETAILED EXPLANATION OF INHERITANCE ===

üîç WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CODE:

1. INHERITANCE HIERARCHY:
   ‚Ä¢ Vehicle (Parent/Super class)
   ‚Ä¢ Car extends Vehicle (Child/Sub class)
   ‚Ä¢ Motorcycle extends Vehicle (Child/Sub class)
   ‚Ä¢ SportsCar extends Car (Grandchild - Multi-level inheritance)

2. INHERITANCE SYNTAX:
   ‚Ä¢ class Child extends Parent { }
   ‚Ä¢ Child class inherits all non-private members of parent
   ‚Ä¢ Child can add its own members and override parent methods

3. SUPER KEYWORD:
   ‚Ä¢ super() - calls parent constructor
   ‚Ä¢ super.methodName() - calls parent method
   ‚Ä¢ Must be first statement in constructor

4. METHOD OVERRIDING:
   ‚Ä¢ Child class provides specific implementation of parent method
   ‚Ä¢ @Override annotation ensures correct overriding
   ‚Ä¢ Same method signature as parent method

5. PROTECTED ACCESS MODIFIER:
   ‚Ä¢ protected members accessible in child classes
   ‚Ä¢ More access than private, less than public
   ‚Ä¢ Good for inheritance hierarchies

6. POLYMORPHISM WITH INHERITANCE:
   ‚Ä¢ Vehicle[] array can hold Car, Motorcycle, SportsCar objects
   ‚Ä¢ Runtime decides which method to call (dynamic method dispatch)
   ‚Ä¢ Same method call produces different behavior

üìö KEY CONCEPTS LEARNED:

‚Ä¢ Inheritance: IS-A relationship (Car IS-A Vehicle)
‚Ä¢ Code Reusability: Child inherits parent's functionality
‚Ä¢ Method Overriding: Child customizes parent's behavior
‚Ä¢ Super keyword: Access parent class members
‚Ä¢ Multi-level inheritance: Chain of inheritance
‚Ä¢ Polymorphism: One interface, multiple implementations

üéØ IMPORTANT POINTS FOR INDIAN STUDENTS:

‚Ä¢ Inheritance = ‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∂‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤‡•Ä (family tree)
‚Ä¢ Parent class = ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ-‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§æ (parents give traits to children)
‚Ä¢ Child class = ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á (children inherit traits but can be different)
‚Ä¢ Method overriding = ‡§¨‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡§æ ‡§§‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç (children develop their own ways)
‚Ä¢ Super keyword = ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ-‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§æ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Æ‡§¶‡§¶ ‡§≤‡•á‡§®‡§æ (taking help from parents)

üí° REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:

‚Ä¢ Vehicle = General concept of transportation
‚Ä¢ Car = Specific type with 4 wheels, doors, trunk
‚Ä¢ Motorcycle = Specific type with 2 wheels, different features
‚Ä¢ SportsCar = Special car with racing features
‚Ä¢ All inherit basic vehicle properties but have unique features

üîë INHERITANCE BENEFITS:

‚Ä¢ Code Reusability: Write once, use in multiple child classes
‚Ä¢ Method Overriding: Customize behavior in child classes
‚Ä¢ Hierarchical Organization: Logical structure of related classes
‚Ä¢ Polymorphism: Treat different objects uniformly
‚Ä¢ Extensibility: Easy to add new types without changing existing code

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES:

‚Ä¢ Java supports single inheritance only (one direct parent)
‚Ä¢ Child inherits all non-private members
‚Ä¢ Constructor is not inherited but can be called using super()
‚Ä¢ Method overriding requires same signature
‚Ä¢ Cannot override static, final, or private methods

üé≠ INHERITANCE vs COMPOSITION:

‚Ä¢ Inheritance: IS-A relationship (Car IS-A Vehicle)
‚Ä¢ Composition: HAS-A relationship (Car HAS-A Engine)
‚Ä¢ Inheritance: Tight coupling, compile-time relationship
‚Ä¢ Composition: Loose coupling, runtime relationship

üîÑ METHOD RESOLUTION:

‚Ä¢ Child object calls method
‚Ä¢ First check in child class
‚Ä¢ If not found, check in parent class
‚Ä¢ Continue up the hierarchy until found
‚Ä¢ If @Override, child version is called

üåü BEST PRACTICES:

‚Ä¢ Use inheritance for IS-A relationships
‚Ä¢ Keep parent classes general, child classes specific
‚Ä¢ Override methods to provide specialized behavior
‚Ä¢ Use super() in child constructors
‚Ä¢ Document inheritance relationships clearly
